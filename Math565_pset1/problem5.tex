\begin{problem}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a simple graph with no triangles. Prove that there is a partition $V = X\sqcup Y$ of the vertices into two disjoint parts, so that for any $x\in X$, we have $d(x) \leq |Y|$ and for any $y\in Y$, we have $d(y) \leq |X|$. Here $d(x)$ denotes the degree of a vertex $x$. Hint: Make a careful choice of a vertex $x$, and let $Y$ be its set of neighbors.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $x_0$ be the point with the highest degree, and let $Y$ be the set of its neighbors. Since there is no triangles and it is a simple graph, any two vertex in the set $Y$ are not connected to each other, and we then gather the rest of the vertices along with $x_0$ to be the set $X$.

        \quad Since $d(x_0) = |Y|$, then $\forall x \in X, d(x) \leq d(x_0) = |Y|$ by the definition of $x_0$. Then we want to see if $\forall y \in Y, d(y) \leq |X|$.

        \quad And we see indeed the case! Since vertices in $Y$ are disjoint, they can only incident with vertices in $X$. And the most number vertices it can incident to is the size of the set $X$, which is $|X|$. In particular we have $d(y) \leq |X|$.

        \quad So we successfully find the set $X$ and $Y$ that satisfy the requirement.
    \end{proof}
